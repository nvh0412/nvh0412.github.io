# One year in Australia: Embracing the unknown.

For me, relocating to Australia from Vietnam was a leap into the Uknown, a decision made without a clear plan but driven by a sense of adventure. One year passed, so yeah, relfecting on the last year, it's been a whirlwind of challenges and beautiful discoveries. From adjusting to a new culture to exploring many stunning landscapes, this journey has been one of resiliece and growth.

It was a stroke of luck that I had secured a promising job with a comfortable salary before landing in Sydney. As someone prone to overthinking, the transition is always daunting, but suprisingly, the reality of living in Australia was not as challenging as my anxious mind has painted it. However, navigating a new culture while tending to the well-being of my beloved wife was added an unexpected layer of complexity to our journey. Now, looking back on a year that's passed by in the blink of eye. I can proudly say we made it through, safe and sound.

## 1. Settling In
In first 3 months, it might be same as many of you who's been relocating, the initial months were a blur of uncertainty and excitement. Living in Aribnb allowed us to discover, navigate the new surroundings before settling in Bankstown. Here, in Bankstown, we found comfort in the familiar tastes of Vietnamese cuisine, a piece of home in the foreign land. Interestingly, reconnecting with an old colleague, Hieu, brought a unique experience to my social circle.

And then, my wife and I obtained the Australia driver's licenses, a milestone that our Aussie friends tole us that it would grant us a newfound sense of freedom. True to their words, having a driver license in Australia just likes openning a door to the beautiful nature in Autralia. One memoriable drive took us to Marrickville, a place close to our hearts for its hidden gems, there is one of most famous Banh Mi (Pork roll) in there. It was Hieu, our dear friend who accompanied us to this nostalgic spot. As he told us about his uni days spent living in Marrickville. However, it was ironic that we drove to the M5 twice, it's the Sydney high way here and as a result, we was charged twice for a short trip, it was fun eventually.

## 2. Sydney's charms
Exploring Sydney, from Bondi to Manly, unveilved the city's diversity landscapes and vibrant culture. Seeing Jacaranda season twice was a testament, these blooms, vibrant and spellbinding, captured our hearts.

Our wanderlust led us through a jouney along Kent st, Market st, George st, where the CBD of Sydney is living, we revealed the China town, feeling lost at the architecture of the Town hall building and QBV and of course embraced the waterfront allure of Darling harbor. The Rocks, a historical gem, the iconic Opera house and walking admist the city's skyline, the Sydney harbor brigde.

Living in Sydney means we can join in on Australia's celebrations, and boy, we did have a blast! Last year, we celebrated Christmast, welcomed the New year, and soaked up all the colors and fun of the Vivid event. Each one had its own special charm, even if it would become a lit less suprising after the first time. Speak of the first time, the first time we saw the firework under the Sydney harbor bridge on the New Year's Eve was pure magic. The excitement lingered even as we dashed to catch the late train home to Bankstown at 3AM. What a night, what a rush!. During Vivid, we saw the Opera House light up like a dream while we cruised by with Hieu, Trang and Trang's friends.

## 3. Exploring New South Wales
Our exploration of NSW was a highlight of our Australia experience. The Snowy mountains provided a magical moment that felt unforgetable, engaging in skiing, witnessing the transformation from a heavy rain to delicate snowfall was a sight that etched itself into our memories, a fleeting moment of nature's enchantment, feel like a rare gift. We drove to Wollongong a lots, spending time with friends (Hieu and Trang) and contemplating a potential move to here, to live and enjoy, at least, this is one of affordable places that we can buy a house.

## 4. Queensland Adventures.
A trip to Cairns, Queensland, was an expedition into the wonder of nature. Discovering the Great barrer reef and scuba diving for the first time (again, yeah the first time) were experiences that brought immense joy. But well, the trip itself was an adventure too! Catching that early 6AM flight in Sydney meant we had to be at the airport at 4AM in a whole new country woohoo.

Then, out in Cairns, we hoped on a boat to reach the Great Barrier reef. Now, I'm not used to boat rides, I come from the highland place, 2 hours on a boat felt like a never-ending rollercoaster, I threw up a couple of times, well, let's just say it wasn't my finest moment. But the sight of that breathtaking reef make it all worth it, paid off completely.

When we went scuba diving, some tourist folks snapped a bunch of photos of us. But when they asked us to pay for those pics (we thought they're free, frankly, we're so naive), my wife thought they were way too expensive, but later, she wished she hadn't. Looking back, I wish I understand her feeling better. I'd have bought those pictures in a heartbeat to keep our beautiful memories alive.

So, a year has flown by, marked by unexpected triumphs and the warmth of discovering familiarity in a foreign land. As we look forward, I am grateful for the challenges that have shaped us the moments in Australia. Here, writting for more years to come in Australia.
