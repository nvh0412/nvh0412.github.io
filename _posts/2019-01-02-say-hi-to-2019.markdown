# Say HI to 2019

It’s so great to stay here and write some interesting thing to welcome a new year. I actually don’t have any plan to write a blog or whatever to start a new journey, and can not explain why I was typing some mindless things haha.

But the time when we start a new year, it’s always the best moment and it has profound effect. We can start a plan or even more we can do it at this moment. So I think now I know the reason why I put my ass here and keep typing, I need a change, a big change, or even a big jump or whatever.

Back to the past, I’m always the guy who want to have a dream future, tried to draw something that beyonds my expectectation whereas I didn’t do anything in reality, just hope and think.

So I’m about to write down some expecation for this year, and next new year's eve It will be a shame if I have any excuse for the things that I can’t complete them

Here is my wishlist (or I can call it Hoa.Nguyen expectation list)

1. Practice english skill - I’m going to write 1 english blog per month
2. Archive IELTS point that greater or equal than 7.0
3. Fnish FastBill - at least I have to finish some basic features of it
