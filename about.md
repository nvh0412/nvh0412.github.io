My interests are in the latest techniques for sophisticated full-stack
development. Development of complex applications/systems which apply lightweight
stack is my focus, delivering a high-quality application.

I have experience with many major javascript frameworks, mobile frameworks, and
backend frameworks. I have experience managing large and complicated application
code bases. In the past roles, I've introduced unit testing, continuous
integration, and automated integration testing.

I like to approach Software problems with an engineering mindset. I really like
work with other developers who want to share my passion and obsession over the
software.
